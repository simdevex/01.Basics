'''
We are making n stone piles! The first pile has n stones. If n is
even, then all piles have an even number of stones. If n is odd, all
piles have an odd number of stones. Each pile must have more stones
than the previous pile but as few as possible. Write a Python
program to find the number of stones in each pile. 
Input: 2
Output:
[2, 4]

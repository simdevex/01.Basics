'''
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia:
A happy number is defined by the following process:
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum
of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number
equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which
does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in
1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.

Write a Python program to check whether a number is "happy" or not.

Sample Input:
(7)
(932)
(6)
Sample Output:
True
True
False

Given an array of numbers representing a branch on a binary
tree, write a Python program to find the minimum even value and its
index. In the case of a tie, return the smallest index. If there are no
even numbers, the answer is []. Go to the editor
Input:
[1, 9, 4, 6, 10, 11, 14, 8]
Output:
Minimum even value and its index of the said array of numbers:
[4, 2]
Input:
[1, 7, 4, 4, 9, 2]
Output:
Minimum even value and its index of the said array of numbers:
[2, 5]
Input:
[1, 7, 7, 5, 9]
Output:
Minimum even value and its index of the said array of numbers:
[]
